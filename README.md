# Chess-AI

ðŸš€ Excited to share our journey in developing a Chess AI Game using Python and Pygame! ðŸŽ®ðŸ¤–

We recently wrapped up a project where we built a fully functional chess game. Here are the key points and some insights from our Chess Game Implementation Report:

Our chess game development involved three main files, each crucial for different aspects of the game:
1. ChessEngine.py:
  - Core Logic: Manages game state, moves, and special moves (castling, enpassant).
  - Classes: `GameState` for board state management and `Move` for representing moves.
  - Functionality: Move generation, validation, and execution, including checkmate and stalemate conditions.

2.  ChessAI.py :
  -  AI Player : Utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to determine the best moves.
  -  Best Move Finder : `findBestMove` function processes the game state and valid moves to decide the optimal move.
  -  Evaluation : Scoring based on material balance, piece positions, and game state.

3.  ChessMain.py :
  -  Main Driver : Handles user input, graphics updates, and the game loop.
  -  Pygame Interface : Manages the game board display, event handling, move highlighting, piece animation, move logs, and end-game conditions.

	
This project was a fantastic learning experience, combining AI with game development. It also underscored the importance of troubleshooting and resourcefulness in overcoming challenges.

Feel free to check out our GitHub repository for more details and code snippets. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and feedback!
